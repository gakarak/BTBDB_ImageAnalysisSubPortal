Gaussian-weighted projection uses a Gaussian function as the weighting function during the projection processing. The CT values within a calcification region can be described as a series of variables with an approximate Gaussian distribution. The image intensities within this region are described as I∼N (μ, σ2), where μ is the mean intensity and σ is the standard deviation. In order to find the most optimal parameters, we search μ from 10–990 Hounsfield Units (HU) and σ from 20–280 HU. For each pair of μ and σ values, we generate projection images of the whole chest along the PA direction. We visually evaluate the quality of the projection images. We grade the images as excellent, good, fair, and poor. Based on the grades, we can determine which pair of μ and σ better show calcification.
